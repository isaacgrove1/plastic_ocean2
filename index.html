        Plastic production has been increasing at an alarming rate since the
        1950s. Unsurprisingly so has macro and micro plastics found in our
        oceans. Plastic can take up to one thousand years to degrade completely.
        So, yes almost every piece of plastic us humans have ever generated
        still exists as plastic somewhere in the world. Once some of those
        pieces begin sneaking into the world’s oceans they tend to stay there.
        The vastness and depths of the world’s oceans makes plastic almost
        impossible to identify, let alone recover.
        <br /><br />
        The amount of plastic pumped into the ocean is almost incomprehensible.
        In 2015, the macro plastic found in the world’s oceans is estimated to
        be the equivalent weight of a fleet of 5000 Boeing 747s. That’s more
        than quadruple the amount of 747s that have ever even been built.

          Plastic kills.
          <br /><br />
          Plastic often does not breakdown completely for hundreds of years,
          Plastic tends to fragment into multiple pieces, Plastic can be in the
          shape of food or prey for larger marine animals.
          <br /><br />
          Plastic is malicious in the ocean and has the ability to harm almost
          every creature in the marine food-chain. In fact, it is estimated that
          56% of the world’s marine animal species have previously consumed
          plastic.
          <br /><br />
          Furthermore, high concentrations of plastic in the ocean have also
          been linked to higher levels of coral bleaching, which puts
          strain on primary producers and in turn the entire marine food
          web.

        The two biggest global producers of plastic waste as one might expect
        are in fact China and the US. However, these two heavily industrialised
        countries seem to have some semblance of a waste management system which
        prevents too much waste being emitted to the world’s oceans.
        When we look at the biggest emitters of plastic to the ocean,
        unexpectedly we find that the <b><span style='color:#2EC4B6' #BA5624>Philippines account for over one third of
        the entire global share (36.4%).</span></b> For a country which accounts for under
        2% of the global population and less than 1% of the global landmass,
        this is certainly a surprising finding.
        <br /><br />
        It seems to be a perfect (or imperfect) storm of factors that contribute
        to this staggering figure. First of all, excess amounts of plastic are
        used to package almost every product bought in the Philippines. Poor waste management
        services and a lack of enforcement for dumping means that a large amount
        of this waste is discarded in an irresponsibly way.
        <br /><br />
        Furthermore Being a nation of islands, most large population centres naturally live
        along some section of coastline. Many of these populations are slums
        without access to any type of waste collection services. Dumping rubbish
        into rivers and the ocean is often the only choice left for these low
        socio-economic communities.

          Plastic pollution in the ocean is significantly linked to the
          high levels of plastic pollution in Filipino rivers. An astonishing 7
          out of the 10 most plastic polluting rivers in the world are situated
          in the Philippines. It is a stretch to even call some of these
          entities “rivers”; given the sickening amount of plastic which is
          distributed among these waterways.

        So, what is being done to address this issue? In 2012, the city of
        Manila implemented a ban on plastic shopping bags and Styrofoam
        containers in an effort to curb the masses of plastic waste that was
        being generated. Other waste management initiatives such as the Plastic
        Waste Trading Hub have also been established as stations where plastics
        can be responsibly recycled.
        <br /><br />
        However, more can be done. Projections made in 2020 by the Filipino
        government forecasted up to a 20% increase in waste production between
        2020-25 in some surrounding areas of the Pasig River in Manilla. The map
        below shows the top five projections of areas expected to increase waste
        over these years.
